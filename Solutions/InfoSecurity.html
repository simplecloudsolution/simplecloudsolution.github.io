            <br>
            <i>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA<br>
            </i><br>
            A major Pacific Rim computer manufacturer realized it was six months 
            behind its closest competitor regarding the development of disk drive 
            storage technology. Looking to rapidly catch up, company 
            representatives approached a U.S. consultant, who was a former 
            employee of their competitor. The manufacturer approached the consultant to steal the 
            technology it needed not realizing that the &quot;consultant&quot; they had 
            hired was actually an undercover agent. The case resulted in the 
            arrest and conviction of 19 individuals; many of which were not U.S. 
            citizens.<br>
            <br>
            <i>PHOENIX, ARIZONA</i><br>
            <br>
            A former Silicon Valley software engineer stole plans, worth tens of 
            millions of dollars, for a major U.S. semiconductor manufacturer's 
            most competitive product. The engineer sent videotapes detailing the 
            manufacturing process to a rival firm, for whom he had also once 
            worked, which immediately alerted the victim company and the 
            competitor, who cooperated with the investigation. The ensuing 
            investigation revealed that, in his capacity as a key employee, the 
            engineer remotely accessed his employer's corporate databank from 
            his home and obtained the plans for microprocessor manufacturing. He 
            videotaped his monitor screen as opposed to electronically 
            downloading the information. He claims to have given the stolen 
            technology to several countries, including China, North Korea, Iraq 
            and Cuba. He was convicted and spent three years in federal prison.<br>
            <br>
            <i>PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA</i><br>
            <br>
            In lieu of military service in his home country, an apprentice 
            programmer obtained employment with an U.S. software developer. Upon 
            completing his obligation, he gave two weeks' notice to his U.S. 
            employer and began making plans for his return home. He also began 
            to work nights and weekends -- unusual behavior for this typical 9am 
            to 5pm employee. The software developer became suspicious. A 
            programming audit revealed that he was also downloading his 
            employer's source code. As it turned out, the foreign national was 
            packing more than clothes and souvenirs from his year in the States. 
            He was arrested boarding an international flight home.<br>
            <br>
            <i>SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA</i><br>
            <br>
            Four individuals stole supercomputer technology from their employer 
            by copying sensitive documents, tapes and diskettes at night and on 
            weekends. Traveling to the former Soviet Union, they negotiated 
            selling the information. The suspects were identified and arrested. 
            The duplicated proprietary documents, valued at $15 million, was 
            recovered from a storage locker in Fremont, CA. Three of the four 
            individuals were convicted; the fourth fled the country and 
            subsequently died. <br>
            <br>
            <i>SAN CARLOS, CALIFORNIA</i><br>
            <br>
            Two anonymous letters to the victim company precipitated an 
            investigation into the theft of blueprints for semiconductor 
            manufacturing equipment by individuals who, after copying the design 
            specs, became a successful competitor. During the investigation it 
            was determined that three (3) additional companies were being 
            victimized. With no R&amp;D costs, nor draftsmen or engineers to employ, 
            they were able to undercut the victim company by 40% and made 
            millions of dollars in a matter of months, before the scheme was 
            discovered. Six perpetrators were arrested and convicted. Several of 
            the thieves were employees of the victims companies. The culprit 
            company is no longer in business.<br>
            <br>
            <i>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA</i><br>
            <br>
            A trusted employee of a software developer stole source code from 
            his employer in order to start a competing company. The thief 
            created a new name, logo and screen design for the bogus operation 
            and sold copies throughout the world advertising in Dr. Dobbs 
            magazine. A reference buried deep in the original program -- bearing 
            the name of the victim company -- went unaltered, and was 
            subsequently discovered by a customer. The customer alerted the 
            victim company. Upon completing an investigation, the majority of 
            the pirated software was recovered and the unscrupulous employee was 
            arrested and convicted. <br>
            <br>
            <i>SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA</i><br>
            <br>
            Relying on old business cards for identification, a Japanese 
            national represented himself as a customer and obtained confidential 
            information and prototypes. The subject was employed by a competitor 
            who used the purloined information in presentations on its competing 
            product. The Japanese national was arrested when he reentered the 
            U.S. from Japan. He was subsequently convicted and deported.<br>
            <br>
            <i>SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA</i><br>
            <br>
            An individual was selling counterfeit action figures on an internet 
            auction site. An 
            investigation ensued and resulted in the confiscation of piratical 
            items from the advertiser, his supplier and in the identification of 
            the importer. Multiple Cease and Desist orders were filed. <br>
